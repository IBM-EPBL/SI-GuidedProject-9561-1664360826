Plasma is the liquid portion of blood. About 55% of our blood is plasma, and the remaining 45% 
are red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets that are suspended in the plasma.
Plasma is about 92% water. It also contains 7% vital proteins such as albumin, gamma globulin 
and anti-hemophilic factor, and 1% mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones and vitamins.
Plasma is commonly given to trauma, burn and shock patients, as well as people with severe
liver disease or multiple clotting factor deficiencies. It helps boost the patient’s blood volume,
which can prevent shock, and helps with blood clotting.
In a plasma-only donation, the liquid portion of the donor’s blood is separated from the cells. 
Blood is drawn from one arm and sent through a high-tech machine that collects the plasma.
The donor’s red blood cells and platelets are then returned to the donor along with some saline.
The process is safe and only takes a few minutes longer than donating whole blood.
Many of them need plasma if we donate plasma to others it will be useful for others and us also.
